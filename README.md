EncumbranceTracker v1.1, by Justin Freitas

ReadMe and Usage Notes

This 5e based extension will monitor the PC's encumbrance on every Combat Tracker activation of an actor (clicking that row to move the turn to a PC or simply the Next Actor button) or via a chat command (either /et or /encumbrance).  If a PC is encumbered according to the 5e rules (standard or variant/optional), an effect will be placed on the CT actor designating the encumbrance level (mostly applicable to variant encumbrance) and some rules around that encumbrance level will be displayed (if configured in the options).

GM EncumbranceTracker Chat Commands:

/et or /encumbrance - This will run the encumbrance analysis on all of the PCs in the Combat Tracker, even if combat is not active.
